        The best way to prevent instances of being "buzzed" is to be seen

   While it may be true that some of these buzzing issues come about because of 
   angry motorists. Many of the issues also come about because of the difficulty 
   of seeing a cyclist. So what can you do to be seen? 

</p> 

<h3>
        The simplest way to be seen is to wear neon clothes and always ride 
        with lights!
</h3>

    Many cyclists think that neon clothes and lights are nudry. That wearing 
    neon clothes makes them look "less pro" then those who do not wear them. The 
    same feeling goes for lights. Many cyclists feel that lights are for "joeys".
    But I ask the question, <strong>is looking "cool" or "pro" worth getting hit 
        over?</strong> Simply put, it is not! 
</p>

<p>
    If you are wondering what I am talking about when I mention the neon clothes, 
    they are essentially what they sound like, very bright bicycle clothes. Often 
    they come as a best so you can wear it anytime of the year. An example of such 
    a vest is below. You can find this type of cycling clothing at any bicycle shop.

    So now that we know what to wear, now how about lights? Lights are incredibly
    helpful in being seen, especially at night. In fact, they are so helpful that 
    some municipalities now require cyclists to use light after dusk and before dawn. 
</p>

<p>
    The best configuration for lights is to have a white light on the front and 
    a blinking red light on the back. Again, these lights can be found at any bicycle
    shop or online.
