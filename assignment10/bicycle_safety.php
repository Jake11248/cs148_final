    <h3>
        Every year around <Strong>19,000</strong> cyclists are injured in car related accidents. Of 
        these injuries around <strong>800</strong> result in deaths. 
     </h3>
        
<p>
    Many of these accidents occur when drivers get too close to cyclists, when they 
    'buzz' them. While there are many reason a driver may buzz a cyclist from anger 
    at the cyclists to not paying attention, all of these buzzing's create an unsafe 
    environment for cyclists. 
</p> 

<p>
    Now you may be wondering why very little is done to try and help prevent cyclists 
    from being "buzzed." The simple reason is that there is no data recorded about 
    buzzings. We record statistics on the outcome of these buzzings, deaths. But
    there is not a centralized place to record these buzzings. This is where Buzzkiller
    comes in. 
</p>

<p>
    The goal of buzzkiller is to gain data about where these buzzings occur. Are 
    certain drivers known for buzzing cyclists? Are certain streets more dangerous 
    then others? Is there a certain time of day that is more dangerous than other 
    times of day?
